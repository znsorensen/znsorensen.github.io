<p class="Bio">
I am a current Master's in XXX student at YYY, formerly a consultant for the Department of Energy on their Appliance Standard Program. I am always interested in learning about and working with innovative solutions—whether in business, finance, technology, or policy. I have a particular interest in energy, the built environment, and electrification. 
  
This site serves as a respository for projects, complete and incomplete, as well as hosting my personal professional information.
